# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

            BerlinBand is a platform designated to cater to all of your bands needs and wishes.<br> 
            Over the last decade terms such as "recording studio", "producer" have lost their original meaning, 
            so if you're confused or not sure where to post we've put a few questions together to help you orient yourself.<br> 
            If you answer "yes" to any of these questions, you should most likely post in the corresponding category, 
            so that your posts will be seen by your target audience.

          producer: Producer
          producer_text_html: >
            "Many people mistake a producer to a recording engineer a mixing engineer and sometimes even a fairy so 
            let's set one thing straight:<br> A producer does not have to push a single button in order to produce a record. 
            The producers job is to produce a certain product (LP, EP, demo, live recording etc'...) under the given 
            circumstances (budget, time-frame, production needs, style etc'...). <br><br> 
            wanted:<br> 
            - Are you interested in recording an album/EP/live show or any commercially distributed product and don't 
            know how to proceed? than I highly recommend hiring, or at least consulting a producer. 
            Having an objective set of ears and the expertise of someone who already has a few records under his/her 
            belt is very beneficial for the final product, and if that isn't enough it can also significantly reduce 
            the costs of the production.<br><br> 
            seeking:<br> 
            - Are you a producer? have you just graduated from audio engineering school and looking to establish your reputation? 
            are you looking for fresh talent that will top the charts if given a bit of guidance? 
            than this is the place for you.
